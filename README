Step 1: Clone the Repo
**`git clone https://github.com/Shradhdha03/cypress-cucumber-test-project.git`**

Step 2: open the repo in **Vistual Studio Code**

Step 3: Run **`npm install`**

Step 4: Run** **`./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`**
For the first time it may take some time and it may give error saying *it looks like you are using cypress first time*)
Just re run the same command and it should launch cypress and run the demo feature file.
The demo feature file does ui testing using google search.
